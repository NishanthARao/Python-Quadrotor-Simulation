# Python-Quadrotor-Simulation

This is an ongiong project, which aims to provide a versatile platform for testing reinforcement learning algorithms on a quadrotor system. There are in-build PID controllers that can be used for attitude, altitude and position control of the drone. The simulation platform is built on matplotlib, and is currently being developed. As of now, the drone is represented by a single point, at it's centre of mass.
